<h1 style="color:#000000;font-size:30px;font-family:Serif;text-decoration:underline">Learn Touch Typing with Xpert Typing</h1>
<h2><p style="color:#000000	">Touch typing is the ability to use muscle memory to find keys fast, without using the sense of sight, and with all the available fingers, just like piano players do. It significantly improves typing speed and eliminates errors. Touch typing simply makes you more productive and it is a skill worth learning. However, many people engage in the bad habit of ‘hunt-and-peck’ typing, even those seasoned professionals with years and decades of computer experience. It is easy to understand, though, as touch typing requires dedicated practice to learn it well. That is why we created Xpert Typing, a free online typing tutorial, to give you the most advanced learning experience and let you develop your typing skills faster.</h2></p>

<li>Place your hands on the keyboard appropriately, so that your left forefinger is on the ‘F’ key, and the right one is on the ‘J’ key. You should feel the bump at the bottom of each of these keys.</li>
<li>Group keys in zones and only use appropriate finger for each key. Use the illustration below to learn which finger is responsible for every key.</li>
<li>Always return fingers to the initial position after each keystroke</li>
<li>Try not to look at the keyboard, but look at the screen only. If you are stuck, use the virtual keyboard to find the proper key.</li>
<li>Please do not rush. First learn to type accurately, and only then improve your typing speed</li>
